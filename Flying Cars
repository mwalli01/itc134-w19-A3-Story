 I think it's cool to see flying cars.
They are so fast man. so so fast.
And they can fly to the edge of the atmosphere.
Yes they can fly to edge of the atmosphere, and I wish to live for long time, to see flying cars.
The idea of flying cars are so cool, but what is cooler is getting to know Github. 
Getting to know Git will help us program these futuristic flying cars.

This is not about flying.
It's more like a question.
The assignment  (A3: Branch, Pull, Merge, Repeat)
Do we come up another story or this is it (flying cars).
Please let me

We can change if you want to. It makes no difference in the learning.
